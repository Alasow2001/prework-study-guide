## Description

This study guide is made for boot camp students who are starting the course. This website contains basic notes about HTML, CSS, JavaScript and Git.

## Installation

1. Install VSCode (Link: https://code.visualstudio.com/download).
2. Download the required extensions to get the most of the application (Chrome DevTools, HTML CSS Support).
3. Install Git for Windows users (Mac users can use the command terminal).

## Usage

You can review the notes of each section, comparing them with your own notes throughout the course. For suggestions on what to study first, open the Chrome DevTools by pressing Command+Option+I (macOS) or Control+Shift+I (Windows). A console panel should open either below or to the side of the webpage in the browser. There you will see a list of topics we learned from the prework along with a suggestion on which topic to study first.
